White  Spot,LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn't pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house). I have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. I'm no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!,0.5268817204301075
White  Spot,I love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.,0.5161290322580645
White  Spot,Love this product I use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options. The only thing I would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on it's own. Like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode.,0.5161290322580645
White  Spot,"What a great little gadget for the house. You ask and it delivers, period. Well done!",0.5161290322580645
White  Spot,I love the size of the echo spot. It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It‚Äôs small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.,0.5053763440860215
White  Spot,The thing I like most about my Echo Spot is the voice command feature.  You can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the Echo. Easy to use,0.5053763440860215
White  Spot,"I own 5 Echo devices, consider me addicted! This little number is awesome, not only do I like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other Echo devices. One feature I really like is how it slowly dims after I turn off my bedroom light, so I have a night light for a bit. I love Echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!",0.4731182795698925
White  Spot,The echo spot is really great. I just got it and is easy to set up. I do have one problem. When the advertise it they show a screen with the time weather and your town. Sadly there is no way to make this the home screen. The home screen is just the timeüòî. I spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail. I am disappointed because I wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate. I am hoping they will do something about this. Other than that it‚Äôs great,0.45161290322580644
White  Spot,"We've owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven't found much use for them.  We just don't find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks.",0.45161290322580644
White  Spot,I do like the product we bought it on Prime day but this week it was $30 cheaper then Prime day. Still a really cool device. I wish I would have waited.,0.45161290322580644
White  Spot,"Omg where do I start, I LOVE THIS THING! None bad to say!",0.44086021505376344
White  Spot,I love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..,0.44086021505376344
White  Spot,Very helpful with daily activities,0.41935483870967744
White  Spot,I had just said to myself how I desired an assistant when I came across the Spot!  As a Mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone‚Äôs schedules & my own. I just verbally tell Alexa what reminder or timer I need set and Voila!Having my Spot has given me the virtual assistant I so desired without having to actually hire someone.  Not to mention the many other awesome features. I have Alexa synced with my Audible & Kindle & Alex can read a book from my libraries to me.I‚Äôm still excited to see what else my Spot can do!Side note: I had wanted to purchase a Show for a while & probably still will down the line however I sooooo love my sleek little Sopt!,0.3978494623655914
White  Spot,"LOVE love love this!  I have an echo, and several echo dots, but love the video with this and the clock.  I no longer have to wake up and say &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34; or &#34;Alexa, weather&#34;  I can even watch videos on it if i forget my kindle before bed.",0.3870967741935484
White  Spot,"When we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra $30...so we thought why not? Well, I'm so glad we did! We are really enjoying our Echo Spot. It reads stories to our girls, plays music, gives us the news, and so much more!  It's so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy.",0.3870967741935484
White  Spot,"We love using it for bedtime reading on Audible. It's very kid-friendly, and I can see liking it in the kitchen while I'm cooking since it's small and unobtrusive. We like it better than our Echo Dot.",0.3763440860215054
White  Spot,This is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.,0.3763440860215054
White  Spot,I really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is fun.Sometimes it misunderstands what I say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol.,0.3763440860215054
White  Spot,I love the Echo Spot. This bedside alarm clock size device can do what theEcho Show can do. I was concerned because I already had a large Echo in mybedroom that answered to ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù like the other devices in my home. I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him ‚ÄúEcho.‚Äù Now if I could only choose a male voice. I loved that I could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. So many more features. Don‚Äôt forget to buy thestand/base. So many advantages to having that. Read the reviews. Highly recommend.,0.3763440860215054
White  Spot,Very nicely constructed. My wife wanted a second for the kitchen so I order a second one.,0.3655913978494624
White  Spot,Love this little dot with a screen.  Super easy to set up and easy to use.  Instantly connected to all my other echo products.  I also bought the screen cover that has the blocking button for the camera if you want to use it.  Recommended.,0.3655913978494624
White  Spot,so far just ok,0.34408602150537637
White  Spot,Bought this for our son as his birthday present and he loves it.  Often find him jamming to music in his room now  :)  He loves the options for the alarms and we have his weekday alarms set to repeat and he gets to sleep in on non-school days.,0.3333333333333333
White  Spot,Easy set up and to use. I bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather. I set it up for him a gave him a 15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it‚Äôs is great to be able to see him in between visits.,0.3333333333333333
White  Spot,I enjoy this little thing a lot.  Will do almost anything.  I like the jokes it tells.  I‚Äôm still learning different functions,0.3225806451612903
White  Spot,"I use the product as an alarm clock. I love being able to set my schedule for the week and not worry about it. When images are shown, they are cut off. Little because its trying to fit it into a circle.",0.3010752688172043
White  Spot,"I am not easily impressed with electronic goodies. But...OMG this is by far the coolest thing I have ever had.  It does everything short of clean your house... which, when I asked Alexa to clean my house.... was told she didn‚Äôt have hands, but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning!  From reading books to my five year old, to video chat, to silly selfies, music that automatically goes to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, setting timers, alarms, changing my thermostat on voice command, tells me the weather, sends hubby a grocery pick up list, and I am sure. Million more things!BUY IT.....you u will not regret it.",0.3010752688172043
White  Spot,"We like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  You can even hear music played. The speaker is clear.  We are enjoying it.  What we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  The next day, I asked the Echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  The Echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  It was a little disconcerting.",0.2903225806451613
White  Spot,This product has made my life much simpler with a little one. I use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on/off or up/down is a breeze. The screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news!,0.2903225806451613
White  Spot,we like it. very convenient,0.27956989247311825
White  Spot,"It is a good addition to my small space, and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions.",0.26881720430107525
White  Spot,I love the way it is designed. And you have choices for the face.  I use it for my bed side.  I drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.,0.25806451612903225
White  Spot,"Bought this to replace a Sony Dash (remember those?) after Sony decided to pull support from it entirely. It works great for what I use it for: an alarm clock, a weather station, background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house. My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can't turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It 's an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don't want to see as it cycles through content screens. A software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and don't want to see in the content rotation.",0.23655913978494625
White  Spot,Alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on Iheart radio or Spotify I want. Plus when I do get smart home devices she‚Äôll be even more useful to me! She‚Äôs really helpful with answering random questions. The small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but it‚Äôs nice to have something to show time and pictures.,0.23655913978494625
White  Spot,"Simply amazing what a awsome device. It never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. Drop in on the kids and keep in touch. I have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do.",0.21505376344086022
White  Spot,"Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn't work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn't as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who's at the front door.  But, it's great for the bedside.",0.21505376344086022
White  Spot,"This is the best Alexa enabled device you can get, it is so versatile and useful. It sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo. The screen makes all the difference in the world.",0.1935483870967742
White  Spot,"Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it.",0.1935483870967742
White  Spot,Echo Spot works well except it does not work with the Ring doorbell as it states on the website. Since they were sold as a pair I thought that it would be app ready.  Unfortunately that is not case.  Perhaps Ring will update so that they can be integrated.,0.17204301075268819
White  Spot,Speakers are not as loud as Google Home,0.17204301075268819
White  Spot,"Don‚Äôt use it for much as I thought we would. Synced with Kasa-Cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot. Lyrics for music is cool, too. Other than that it‚Äôs used as a clock and standard dot‚Äôish features.",0.16129032258064516

White  Spot,"I like echo spot. I bought it to use as an alarm clock. One negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. In this case a clock with buttons seems to work better",0.11827956989247312
White  Spot,I used it as an alarm clock  i lov it,0.0967741935483871

White  Spot,Not happy with the Spot.  Reset numerous times.  Seems to be in slow mode.  Have to be practically on top of it for it to hear me.  Even after talking with support I still do not have ‚Äúthemes‚Äù in the menu to choose from!,0.06451612903225806

White  Spot,"Great product EXCEPT there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time PERMANENTLY.  When in 'Clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen.  I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot.  How could you get this wrong, Amazon??  #FAIL",0.021505376344086023
White  Spot,"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time.

Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it's supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product.",0.2564102564102564

She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don't know that&#34; for everything else. We've gone back to just using our phones because she can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I'm less than impressed.

White  Plus,"Was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room.

All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.

White,"Love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. If it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo. Proved to be best way to go.",0.5853658536585366

White,"I love this, answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when I don‚Äôt get off the couch",0.24390243902439024
White,Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.,0.24390243902439024

White,"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong.",0.12195121951219512
White,"Initially, this echo dot worked very well. Over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. The other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. Would not recommend buying refurbished.",0.10975609756097561

White,Not good at all!,0.012195121951219513
White,"This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it‚Äôs ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn‚Äôt do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it.",0.012195121951219513

Oak Finish ,"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.",0.42857142857142855

This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale.

Charcoal Fabric ,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.",0.11330049261083744

After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn‚Äôt watch a movie I‚Äôd been dying to see on this, it‚Äôs a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù on this and while it wasn‚Äôt the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn‚Äôt as bad as one would think. I would definitely recommend!",0.3952380952380952

The screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  I loved this so much I purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.

Black  Spot,"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn‚Äôt seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying ‚ÄúAlexa set an alarm for 5am‚Äù and then having Alexa repeat ‚ÄúOK alarm set for 5am.‚Äù  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990‚Äôs and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I‚Äôm picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I‚Äôm in the shower.",0.3

Sometimes I'll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I'm only 8 feet away plus it's on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.

Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.  What a dumb move on Amazons‚Äã part.",0.009523809523809525
Black  Spot,"When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don't allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe.",0.009523809523809525
Black  Spot,Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working‚Äîcalled and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable‚Äîexpected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.,0.004761904761904762

Black  Show,"So far I‚Äôm very pleased with my Echo Show.  The problem is, there‚Äôs so much it can do that I haven‚Äôt been able to explore the extent of its abilities! I got the special price as part of the Prime Day promotion...and you just can‚Äôt beat what you get for the price.  Very pleased with the sound. The video screen is sharp. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I‚Äôm hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I‚Äôve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a ‚Äúlive‚Äùversion is used, not the original version.  If I‚Äôm going to pay for Prime Music...I‚Äôd like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.

Black  Plus,"I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off.  Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and  the Echo Plus with Hub.

Black  Plus,"This is the 3rd unit I purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far.

Also, we should be able to name it on our own instead calling Alexa or Echo. Price can be reduced a bit (value based) and updates should be auto and daily to improve it.

Black  Plus,I like that it‚Äôs voice activated but it don‚Äôt link with any other Bluetooth devices only Alexa devices,0.18565400843881857
Black  Plus,"I‚Äôm having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn‚Äôt work, the timer doesn‚Äôt ends... and Alexa keeps saying she is unavailable.",0.18565400843881857
Black  Plus,Use way more often than we used our Google Home.,0.18143459915611815
Black  Plus,"Pros- plenty loud for a large room with high ceilings.Cons - the hub doesn‚Äôt do anything.  It doesn‚Äôt work with z wave (as it states), it doesn‚Äôt take voice commands for SmartThings, which I had to buy since the hub doesn‚Äôt work for z wave.It also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the EQ. (Not sure if that is on all models, but the Dots we have are clear.For the money, buy an echo dot or echo (2nd generation).  The echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub, go figure, and the audio is clear. The dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper.",0.17721518987341772
Black  Plus,Still needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.,0.17721518987341772
Black  Plus,Personal,0.1729957805907173
Black  Plus,"Nice add on to a home.What I don't like are the limitations, for example world soccer. It won't give you much info of sport teams other than American.",0.1729957805907173
Black  Plus,Not that much different than the one we had.  Alexa is still stubborn. LOL.  We ordered it on the Prime day to get the light bulbs with it i the deal but did not get the light bulbs.  When we called she said they were sold out.  Felt bad about that.  Now we have to buy light bulbs.,0.16877637130801687
Black  Plus,Just got mine last night. Played around with it for a while. Should have bought it a long time ago.,0.16877637130801687
Black  Plus,It get on sale after 2 days so ... CHECK EVENTS BEFORE U BUY THESE AMAZON PRODUCTS!,0.16455696202531644
Black  Plus,I love my Echo Plus. The only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.,0.16033755274261605
Black  Plus,It's like a remedial form of the Star Trek computer in your home,0.16033755274261605
Black  Plus,Although I haven't taken advantage of many of the Echo's features there is one that bothers me. It starts talking even when I haven't said anything even close to the wake up word - ECHO - had to change from Alexa due to a conflict with another device.,0.14767932489451477
Black  Plus,Using as a hub and music.,0.14767932489451477
Black  Plus,So far we have enjoyed it.  The only problem we have is I have not been able to call one of my sons with it (the sad part is he is the one who gave it to me:( ),0.14767932489451477
Black  Plus,Arrived right on time and works as expected,0.12658227848101267
Black  Plus,Its got to be one of the coolest things.,0.12236286919831224
Black  Plus,Music mainly but still checking other features,0.12236286919831224
Black  Plus,I like the list ability and the music I can play.  I do not like that I can not create a playlist without using the app and even then Alexa will not play my songs I have to do it through my tablet or phone.  I also do not like that Alex can not print again it has to be done through the app.,0.12236286919831224
Black  Plus,It's louder than the dot and it's got a built in hub for all the other wireless controls in the house.,0.11814345991561181
Black  Plus,it does everything that it offers.,0.11814345991561181
Black  Plus,Exactly what I wanted with speedy shipping.....thank you so much!,0.11814345991561181
Black  Plus,STILL TRYING TO LINK TO MY SON'S AND DAUGHTER'S IN THEIR ROOMS...,0.11392405063291139
Black  Plus,"Mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time, it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result.",0.11392405063291139
Black  Plus,I can't get multiple profiles working. It just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt,0.10970464135021098
Black  Plus,She's [Alexa] a bit dense and still learning the way I phrase things with my NY/NJ regional accent.,0.09282700421940929
Black  Plus,The built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.  Otherwise would have given it 5 stars.,0.09282700421940929
Black  Plus,The Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would. I have spent multiple hours on this. Made phone calls and texts. Also is missing free bulb.,0.08438818565400844
Black  Plus,"Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It‚Äôs far from being useful.Half the time when you ‚Äúwake‚Äù the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn‚Äôt hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It‚Äôs been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I‚Äôm past the return period...... zzzz",0.08016877637130802
Black  Plus,Didn‚Äôt really work as smooth as they make it seem like.,0.06329113924050633
Black  Plus,I am not tec smart enough to make it work at all. Will send it back if I cant get help. My eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.I just wanted a bigger speaker.,0.06329113924050633
Black  Plus,"I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked.",0.06329113924050633
Black  Plus,no habla espanol,0.05907172995780591
Black  Plus,Alexa didn‚Äôt know answers to many questions we asked. For example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money,0.05907172995780591
Black  Plus,"As an echo its great, Good sound quality and functionality. As a smart home hub, it sucks. No automation, no geo-fencing, no music syncing for hue, no z-wave. All it does is turn things on with your voice. Ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over.",0.05907172995780591
Black  Plus,"I‚Äôm still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine.",0.05485232067510549
Black  Plus,no it is broke and I can't get help fixing or replacing it,0.05063291139240506
Black  Plus,I bought this for myself and i didn‚Äôt realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn‚Äôt convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. It should‚Äôve been more clear when i bought it.,0.05063291139240506
Black  Plus,The echo part works fine.  The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.,0.05063291139240506
Black  Plus,"I'll be returning it.  It's been nothing but annoying.  The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  I found that rather interesting.",0.05063291139240506
Black  Plus,Product does not.  Light bar never went orange.  I googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions. I tried both.  Product is defective,0.03375527426160337
Black  Plus,"Unit came with the wrong plug, will have to send back to Amazon.",0.03375527426160337
Black  Plus,"It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you.",0.029535864978902954
Black  Plus,"When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn't realize and also wasn't fully communicated to me, is that you can't use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I'm only disappointed with the hub's functionalities.",0.029535864978902954
Black  Plus,"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won‚Äôt allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I‚Äôd bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I‚Äôll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.",0.016877637130801686
Black  Plus,Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.,0.016877637130801686
Black  Plus,received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.,0.012658227848101266
Black  Plus,"I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!",0.008438818565400843

Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn't be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box!

I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can't complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source. In order to use the Echo, it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord. It would be nice to use the Echo Dot on the go without having to buy the other product.",0.3333333333333333
